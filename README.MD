# WIP
## This is a work in progress.  It is not ready for use.

## What is this?
This is a fork of [@andreas-mausch](https://github.com/andreas-mausch)'s Whatsapp Viewer tool.
The original one is available [here](https://github.com/andreas-mausch/whatsapp-viewer)
This is a fork of the original tool, written in Rust

It's my first Rust project, so it's probably not the best code you'll ever see, but it *will* work **_eventually_**.
