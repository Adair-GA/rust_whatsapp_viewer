# WIP
## **This is a work in progress.  It is not ready for use.**

## What is this?
This is a fork of [@andreas-mausch](https://github.com/andreas-mausch)'s Whatsapp Viewer tool.
The original one is available [here](https://github.com/andreas-mausch/whatsapp-viewer)
This is a fork of the original tool, written in Rust

It's my first Rust project, so it's probably not the best code you'll ever see, but it *will* work **_eventually_**.


## How to use

1. **You need root access to your phone.** If you don't know what it is: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooting_%28Android%29)
2. Download your WhatsApp database and key files:
  - /data/data/com.whatsapp/databases/msgstore.db
  - /data/data/com.whatsapp/databases/wa.db
3. Open WhatsApp Viewer
4. Place them on the same folder as the executable
5. Run the program (and do what you can which isn't very much atm)
